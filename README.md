# Pattrn Party


## Overview
Wouldnâ€™t it be nice if we had a base template we could refer back to so we could get elements, that we use often, built more quickly and more consistently the next time we need them? The goal of Pattrn Party was to create a small style guide with three components: Accordion Tabs, Flexible Cards, and a Header Bar. The focus was on semantic HTML, well organized and clear CSS, and DRY, well factored Javascript. Each component needed to be responsive from desktop to mobile and persist its current setting. This was a personal project.

## Original Project Requirements 

### Project Overview

Every week you will be given a specific page element to build. It must be responsive and the HTML, CSS, and (when/if needed) JS must be written in a modular way. The goal is to create a small library of page components that can be quickly and easily dropped into a project with minimal work to integrate them into a codebase. Design, fonts, and colors are provided in the comp. The final elements must be built in a way that is straightforward to maintain, user friendly, and easy to drop right into a new codebase.

### Project Requirements

Your final style guide deliverable must meet the following criteria:

* One-page site that must be live (on gh-pages, or Heroku if you want  to be fancy)
* Each weekly exercise should be a section of the one-page site (as shown in comp)
* Site must include the completed element and the associated code (for example: links to a Codepen would be appropriate)
* All elements must be fully responsive and match the comp
